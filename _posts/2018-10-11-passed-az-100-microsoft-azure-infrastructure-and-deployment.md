As you probably know, after last [Microsoft Ignite 2018 in Orlando](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ignite){:target="_blank"} and previously at [Microsoft Inspire 2018 in Las Vegas](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-ee/inspire/){:target="_blank"}, Microsoft has recently changed Azure certifications.

Traditional Microsoft Azure certifications were too broad, covering a huge range of skills. Also, Azure capabilities are continuously expanding and diversifying, making it difficult to maintain under one only big exam.

To fix that end, Microsoft has moved to 3 role-based certifications:

* Microsoft Certified Azure Developer
* Microsoft Certified Azure Administrator
* Microsoft Certified Azure Architect

These new grouping of exams makes more sense than in the past, allowing to focus more on the skills and concepts needed for specific job roles, and avoiding unnecessary things.
