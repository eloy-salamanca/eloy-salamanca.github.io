I like to take Microsoft exams first came out (beta versions), and I was particularly very interested in Azure Stack beta exam: [70-537 Microsoft Exam: Configuring and Operating a Hybrid Cloud with Azure Stack](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-537.aspx){:target="_blank"}

Azure-Stack is an extension of Azure to run hybrid applications on-premises, or as it is called: “To bring the cloud to your datacenter”

With Azure-Stack you will be able to deliver Azure services from your organization’s datacenter, bringing the agility and fast-paced innovation of cloud computing.

This exam measures the following skills:
* Deploying and Integrating an Azure Stack Environment
* Configuring PaaS and IaaS for Azure Stack Environment
* Providing Services to enabling DevOps for Azure Stack Tenants
* Maintaining and Monitoring an Azure Stack Environment

After this exam passed, I renewed [MCSE: Cloud Platform and Infrastructure — Certified 2018](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/8e2e100f-622b-4319-906c-8c0bfc7ca9b3){:target="_blank"}, so I achieved one of my annual goals. I hardly recommend everyone interested in the cloud and Microsoft Stack to try this [70-537 Microsoft Exam: Configuring and Operating a Hybrid Cloud with Azure Stack](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/exam-70-537.aspx){:target="_blank"}
