ProTip: Be sure to remove /docs and /test if you forked Minimal Mistakes. These folders contain documentation and test pages for the theme and you probably don't want them littering up your repo. {: .notice--info}

Note: The theme uses the jekyll-include-cache plugin which will need to be installed in your Gemfile and added to the plugins array of _config.yml. Otherwise you'll throw Unknown tag 'include_cached' errors at build. {: .notice--warning}
